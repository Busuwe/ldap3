   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ldap3's documentation
================================

ldap3 is a pure Python LDAP 3 client library strictly conforming to RFC4510 and is released under the LGPL v3 open source license.
RFC4510 is the current LDAP specification (June 2006) from IETF and obsoletes the previous LDAP RFCs 2251, 2830, 3771 (December 1997).

ldap3 can be used with any Python version starting from 2.6, including all Python 3 versions. It also works with PyPy and PyPy3.


.. warning::
   ldap3 versioning follows `SemVer`_. In version 2 the public API has slightly changed from version 1: some default values have been changed
   and the ldap3 namespace has been decluttered, removing redundant constants (look at the changelog for details). Also, the result code
   constants were moved to ldap3.core.results and the ldap3 custom exceptions were stored in ldap3.core.exceptions. If you experience
   errors in your existing code you should rearrange the import statements or explicitly set the defaults to their former values.
